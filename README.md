# AudreyII - Frontend

AudreyII is a yearly meal planning application. Once signed up a user can create weekly meal plans by searching the millions of recipes on the Edamun API. The user also has the option to print out a grocery list of ingredients out of those week's meals. This is the github repo for the API backend of AudreyII.
